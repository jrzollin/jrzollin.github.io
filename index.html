      The Seattle Freeze is a real problem for people who are new to town. How do you know the Freeze is real? Because it has its very own Wikipedia page, which describes the Freeze as "a belief that it is difficult to make new friends" in Seattle, and observes that newcomers to the city find Seattleites to be "standoffish, cold, distant, and not trusting." The Freeze is a favorite topic among new Seattleites, who often bemoan the affliction for killing their social lives. Because science has yet to quantify this syndrome, we don't fully understand its impact on the population, but anecdotal evidence suggests that untold tens of thousands of people suffer from the Seattle Freeze every year. And because science doesn't yet understand the Seattle Freeze, a cure has evaded experts, and the suffering has continued unabated. Until now.
